Many years ago, I was very unsatisfied with Zabbix builtin templates.

So I took a very close look at how Microsoft System Center Operations Manager worked and tried to recreate it in Zabbix. It's not one-to-one but... inspired by it.

In retrospect I should have broken the functionality into dependancies but it is what it is.
