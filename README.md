Some stuff I wrote for Zabbix over the years, many years ago.

Note that I wrote them when Zabbix had 256 character key limit. I always tried to stick all the queries within keys so I wouldn't have to maintain scripts on servers that I might not have control over. So I did a lot of minification, especially on SQL side.
